// Defining the trial sessions (practice and test)

/*
 Do we actually want to hide the stimulus again? DeHower (2003) didn't:
    "A white fixation cross for 500 ms; the word until a correct response was given;
     if the participant made an incorrect response, a red cross appeared underneath
     the word until the participant pressed the correct key."
For that reason, I also increased the durations a bit towards those numbers.
